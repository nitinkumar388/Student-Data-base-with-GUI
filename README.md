## Introduction -


1. In this article we will develop a Student Management System project using python%u2019s tkinter module along with database connectivity.


2. We will use the tkinter module to design our Graphical User Interface(GUI) and pymysql to establish connectivity with the database.

## Description -

2. The system offers the option to view data of students, employees and department, add new data of the above mentioned parameters, update, delete and also search any particular data.


3. The system is controlled by the admin and has to login when trying to access the data, the system also provides an option to update the password of the admin in order to keep the security of data intact.
